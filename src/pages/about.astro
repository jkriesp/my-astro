    Hello! I'm <strong>Jens Kristian Espevik</strong>, a Cloud Engineer at Accenture, based in Trondheim, Norway. I specialize in helping clients—primarily in the energy sector—transition from on-premise solutions to scalable, secure, and efficient cloud infrastructures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently, I have taken on a consulting project where my primary focus is software development. I work extensively with Next.js to build modern, high-performance web applications while exploring GraphQL for efficient data fetching and AWS Lambda for scalable, serverless backend functions. This shift has allowed me to deepen my full-stack expertise, blending my cloud background with hands-on development.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a consultant, I collaborate closely with clients to understand their business needs and translate them into technical solutions. This experience has reinforced my ability to design scalable, maintainable architectures while embracing best practices in API design, serverless computing, and front-end optimization.
  </p>

  <p>
    This role has also been an opportunity to refine my problem-solving skills in dynamic environments, leveraging GraphQL to optimize API interactions and adopting AWS serverless technologies to build efficient, cost-effective backends. The exposure to diverse client challenges keeps me engaged in continuous learning and innovation.
  </p>

  <p>
    My expertise lies in cloud architecture, infrastructure automation, and security best practices. I am proficient in Azure, backed by AZ-900 and SC-900 certifications, and advocate for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to streamline deployments within CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with React, Next.js, and Spring Boot, allowing me to bridge cloud infrastructure with modern application development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before joining Accenture, I worked in IT operations and service desk roles, where I developed a deep appreciation for automation, scalability, and operational efficiency. My approach to technology is pragmatic and hands-on, ensuring I effectively translate customer needs into robust technical solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about continuous learning, mentoring, and building personal projects. I also enjoy contributing to technical communities and exploring emerging technologies.
