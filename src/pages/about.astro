    I'm <strong>Jens Kristian Espevik</strong>, a Cloud Engineer at Accenture based in Trondheim, Norway. I help organizations—especially in the energy sector—modernize their infrastructure and move from legacy on-premise systems to scalable cloud solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I'm working on a consulting project that's let me dive deep into full-stack development. I'm building modern web applications with Next.js, designing efficient APIs with GraphQL, and creating serverless backends with AWS Lambda. It's been an exciting shift that combines my cloud expertise with hands-on development work.
  </p>

  <p>
    My technical toolkit includes Azure (backed by AZ-900 and SC-900 certifications), Infrastructure as Code, and CI/CD automation. I'm equally comfortable architecting cloud infrastructure as I am building React frontends or Spring Boot services. The sweet spot is where cloud meets code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before Accenture, I cut my teeth in IT operations and service desk roles—experiences that taught me the real value of automation and why systems need to be built for the people who actually have to maintain them.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not working with clients, you'll find me experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open source, or mentoring fellow developers. I believe the best way to stay sharp is to keep building and sharing what you learn.
